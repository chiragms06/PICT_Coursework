# Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory

## Group A

1. A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
   keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to
   display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many
   maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search
   Tree for implementation.

                  OR

Beginning with an empty binary search tree. Construct the binary search tree by
inserting the values in given order. After constructing binary search tree perform
following operations 1) Insert a new node 2) Find numbers of node in longest
path 3) Minimum and maximum data value found in tree 4) Change a tree so that
the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node 5)Search an
element

2. Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting the values
in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations
on it-
 Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal
 Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at
every node
 Find the height of tree
 Copy this tree to another [operator=]
 Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
 Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
(Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods).

3. Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder
traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and space
complexity of the algorithm.

## Group B

4. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two
collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons
required to find a set of telephone numbers (Note: Use linear probing with
replacement and without replacement).

5. Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing technique:
separate chaining using linked list
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be
comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key, value),
Find(key), Delete(key).

## Group C

6. Represent a given graph using adjacency list to perform DFS and BFS. Use the
map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent land
marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

                OR

There are fight paths between the cities. If there is a fight between the city A and
city B then there is an edge between the city A to B. The cost of an edge represent
the time required or fuel required to travel from city A to B. Represent this as a
graph using adjacency list where every node of graph represented by city name.
Perform following operations 1) calculate in degree, out degree of vertices
2)check whether graph is connected or not.

7. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to
connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different
amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that
connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by
suggesting appropriate data structures.

                OR

Tour operator organizes guided bus trips across the Maharashtra. Tourists may
have different preferences. Tour operator offers a choice from many different
routes. Every day the bus moves from starting city S to another city F as chosen
by client. On this way, the tourists can see the sights alongside the route travelled
from S to F. Client may have preference to choose route. There is a restriction on
the routes that the tourists may choose from, the bus has to take a short route from
S to F or a route having one distance unit longer than the minimal distance. Two
routes from S to F are considered different if there is at least one road from a city
A to a city B which is part of one route, but not of the other route.

## Group D

8. Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < ... <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi
for each key ki. Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given
the access probability for each key.

9. A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to
display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many
maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance
tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

## Group E

10. Implement the Heap sort algorithm demonstrating heap data structure with
modularity of programming language.

                OR

Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of
particular subject. Find out maximum / minimum marks obtained in that subject.
Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

## Group F

11. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name,
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display
information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an
appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student
details. Use sequential file to main the data.

12 Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a
direct access file.
