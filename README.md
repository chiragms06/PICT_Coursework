## Group A

1. In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, group B
students play badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET
built-in functions).

2. Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
a) To display word with the longest length
b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string.

3. Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix:
a) Addition of two matrices
b) Subtraction of two matrices
c) Multiplication of two matrices
d) Transpose of a matrix.

## Group B

4. a) Write a pythonprogram to store roll numbers of student in array who attended
training program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular
student attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.
b) Write a python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student
attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search.

5. Write a pythonprogram to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort
c) Insertion sort
d) Shell sort and display top five scores.

6. Write a python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display
top five scores.

## Group C

7. The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be
maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start
with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand
a) The list of available seats is to be displayed
b) The seats are to be booked
c) The booking can be cancelled.

                 OR

   Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day. Appointments are booked
randomly using linked list. Set start and end time and min and max duration for visit slot.
Write functions fora) Display free slots
b) Book appointment
c) Cancel appointment ( check validity, time bounds, availability)
d) Sort list based on time
e) Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation.

8. Second year Computer Engineering class, set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set
B of students like butterscotch ice-cream. Write C++ program to store two sets using
linked list. compute and displaya) Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch
b) Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or not both
c) Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch.

                OR

   Write C++ program for storing binary number using doubly linked lists. Write functionsa) To compute 1‘s and 2‘s complement
b) Add two binary numbers.

## Group D

9. In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.

10. Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation
using stack based on given conditions:
a. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
b. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
c. Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

## Group E

11. Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

12. Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the
items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (which should be
template) and the priority (which should be int). The inorder list should contain these
objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the
beginning of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)

13. A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a onedimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and
delete elements from either end of the deque.
