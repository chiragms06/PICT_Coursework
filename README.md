## Problem Statements

1. Write X86/64 ALP to five hexadecimal numbers from
   user andstore them in an array and display the accepted
   numbers.

2. Write X86/64 ALP to accept the string and to display its length.

3. Write X86/64 ALP to find the largest of the given
   Byte/Word/Dword/64 bit numbers.

4. Write a switch case driven X86/64 ALP to perform 64 hexadecimal
   arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) using suitable macros. Define
   procedure for each operation.

5. Write X86/64 ALP to count number of positive and negative
   numbers from the array.

6. Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent
   BCD number and 5-digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX
   number. Make your program user friendly to accept the choice from
   user for: (a) HEX to BCD
             (b) BCD to HEX
             (c) EXIT. (Display proper strings to prompt the
                 user while acceptingthe input and displaying the
                 result. (wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers).
   
7. Write X86/64 ALP to detect protected mode and display the
   values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR, TR and MSW Registers. Also
   identify CPU type using CPUID instruction.

8. Write X86/64 ALP to perform overlapped block transfer with string
   specific instructions. Block containing data can be defined in the data
   segment.
   
9. Write X86 ALP to find, a) Number of Blank spaces b) Number of
   lines c) Occurrence of a particular character. Accept the data from
   the text file. The text file has to be accessed during Program_1
   execution and write FAR PROCEDURES in Program_2 for the rest
   of the processing. Use of PUBLIC and EXTERN directives is
   mandatory.

10. Write x86 ALP to find the factorial of a given integer number on a
    command line by using recursion. Explicit stack manipulation is
    expected in the code.
