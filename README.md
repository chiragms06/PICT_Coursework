# Laboratory Practice - 01

## Systems Programming

### Two Pass Assembler
Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for
pseudo-machine. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and
few assembler directives. The output of Pass-I (intermediate code file and symbol table) should
be input for Pass-II.

### Two Pass Macro-processor
Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass macroprocessor. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT and intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II.

## Operating Systems

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Preemptive), Priority
(Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive).

### Page Replacement Algorithms
Write a program to simulate Page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU and Optimal).

## Elective - Distributed Systems

### Socket Programming
Implementation of Inter-process communication using socket programming: implementing
multithreaded echo server.

### Election Algorithms
Simulation of election algorithms (Ring and Bully).
