# Object Oriented Programming Laboratory

## Problem Statements

1. Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement
the following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.4. Overloaded << and >> to
print and read Complex Numbers.

2. Develop an object oriented program in C++ to create a database of student information
system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, division, Date of
Birth, Blood group, Contact address, telephone number, driving license no. and other.
Construct the database with suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the
data viz constructor, default constructor, Copy constructor, destructor, static member
functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation
operators-new and delete.

3. Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette
versions. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of
a publication.
From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int), and tape,
which adds a playing time in minutes (type float).
Write a program that instantiates the book and tape classes, allows user to enter data
and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member
values with zero values.

4. Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file
andopen it again as an input file and read the information from the file.

5. Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs
an integer array and a float array.

6. Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching with user defined records such as
person record(Name, DOB, Telephone number), Item record (Item code, name,
cost,quantity) using vector container.

7. Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of
states, and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the
user is prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using
the state name as an index, and returns the population of the state.
